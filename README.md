This Shiny application demonstrates how to chart data using the NIFTY 50 code list. Data is downloaded using the Quandl API and using its chartSeries charts are created on the fly. 
Idea is to upgrade it in such a way that if the user selects 4 stocks , they should be able to get the most optimum allocation to the four stocks. After which a plot of the increase in portfolio value is plotted on the screen given the return and standard deviation of the portfolio
However until now I have used quantmod and TTR packages for charting technicals on the chart series
Happy charting!
